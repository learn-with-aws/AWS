# EC2 Instances

### What is AWS EC2?
------
AWS EC2 is an AWS service that provides compute capacity in the cloud. Like a server, an EC2 instance has resources like a CPU, an operating system, local storage, RAM, etc. With EC2, you can easily build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that’s secure, is exactly what you need, and is available in minutes.

Those server images are called instances. When you spin one up, you choose the instance type, then launch the number of instances you need. You can do this manually, from the Management Console, or programmatically. You only pay for what you use and, when you’re done with your instances, you spin them down and stop paying for them.

### EC2 Family Types :
------
EC2 instances are grouped together into families. Each EC2 family is designed to meet a target application profile in one of these buckets:

    General purpose
    Compute optimized
    Memory optimized
    Storage optimized
    GPU optimized
